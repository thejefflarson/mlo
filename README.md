⬢ mlö ⬢

Silly trie implementation for n-gram language models.

Uses Stupid Backoff (http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/D/D07/D07-1090.pdf) for
weighting.

Stores the ngrams in successive levels, in last-rest order, because querying
will be easier.

  It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my
  administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster
  Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlö.
