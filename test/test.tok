the universe which others call the library is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries with vast air shafts between surrounded by very low railings from any of the hexagons one can see interminably the upper and lower floors the distribution of the galleries is invariable twenty shelves five long shelves per side cover all the sides except two their height which is the distance from floor to ceiling scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase one of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery identical to the first and to all the rest to the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets in the first one may sleep standing up in the other satisfy ones fecal necessities also through here passes a spiral stairway which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances in the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances men usually infer from this mirror that the library is not infinite if it were why this illusory duplication i prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite  light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps there are two transversally placed in each hexagon the light they emit is insufficient incessant
like all men of the library i have traveled in my youth i have wandered in search of a book perhaps the catalogue of catalogues now that my eyes can hardly decipher what i write i am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which i was born once i am dead there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing my grave will be the fathomless air my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall which is infinite i say that the library is unending the idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary from of absolute space or at least of our intuition of space they reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable the mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls but their testimony is suspect their words obscure this cyclical book is god let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum the library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible
there are five shelves for each of the hexagons walls each shelf contains thirtyfive books of uniform format each book is of four hundred and ten pages each page of forty lines each line of some eighty letters which are black in color there are also letters on the spine of each book these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say i know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious before summarizing the solution whose discovery in spite of its tragic projections is perhaps the capital fact in history i wish to recall a few axioms
first the library exists ab aeterno this truth whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind man the imperfect librarian may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi the universe with its elegant endowment of shelves of enigmatical volumes of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian can only be the work of a god to perceive the distance between the divine and the human it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book with the organic letters inside punctual delicate perfectly black inimitably symmetrical
second the orthographical symbols are twentyfive in number 1 this finding made it possible three hundred years ago to formulate a general theory of the library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books one which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninetyfour was made up of the letters mcv perversely repeated from the first line to the last another very much consulted in this area is a mere labyrinth of letters but the nexttolast page says oh time thy pyramids this much is already known for every sensible line of straightforward statement there are leagues of senseless cacophonies verbal jumbles and incoherences i know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of ones palm  they admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twentyfive natural symbols but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves this dictum we shall see is not entirely fallacious
for a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages it is true that the most ancient men the first librarians used a language quite different from the one we now speak it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up it is incomprehensible all this i repeat is true but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable mcvs cannot correspond to any language no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of mcv in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page but this vague thesis did not prevail others thought of cryptographs generally this conjecture has been accepted though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators
five hundred years ago the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book as confusing as the others but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines he showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in portuguese others said they were yiddish within a century the language was established a samoyedic lithuanian dialect of guarani with classical arabian inflections the content was also deciphered some notions of combinative analysis illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition these examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the library this thinker observed that all the books no matter how diverse they might be are made up of the same elements the space the period the comma the twentytwo letters of the alphabet he also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed in the vast library there are no two identical books from these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twentyodd orthographical symbols a number which though extremely vast is not infinite everything the minutely detailed history of the future the archangels autobiographies the faithful catalogues of the library thousands and thousands of false catalogues the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue the gnostic gospel of basilides the commentary on that gospel the commentary on the commentary on that gospel the true story of your death the translation of every book in all languages the interpolations of every book in all books
when it was proclaimed that the library contained all books the first impression was one of extravagant happiness all men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure there was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon the universe was justified the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope at that time a great deal was said about the vindications books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways urged on by the vain intention of finding their vindication these pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors proferred dark curses strangled each other on the divine stairways flung the deceptive books into the air shafts met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions others went mad  the vindications exist i have seen two which refer to persons of the future to persons who are perhaps not imaginary but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a mans finding his vindication or some treacherous variation thereof can be computed as zero
at that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanitys basic mysteries  the origin of the library and of time  might be found it is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be explained in words if the language of philosophers is not sufficient the multiform library will have produced the unprecedented language required with its vocabularies and grammars for four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons  there are official searchers inquisitors i have seen them in the performance of their function they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it looking for infamous words obviously no one expects to discover anything
as was natural this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression the certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible seemed almost intolerable a blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed by an improbable gift of chance these canonical books the authorities were obliged to issue severe orders the sect disappeared but in my childhood i have seen old men who for long periods of time would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder
others inversely believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works they invaded the hexagons showed credentials which were not always false leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves their hygienic ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books their name is execrated but those who deplore the treasures destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts one the library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal the other every copy is unique irreplaceable but since the library is total there are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles works which differ only in a letter or a comma counter to general opinion i venture to suppose that the consequences of the purifiers depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced they were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the crimson hexagon books whose format is smaller than usual allpowerful illustrated and magical
we also know of another superstition of that time that of the man of the book on some shelf in some hexagon men reasoned there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god in the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionarys cult still persist many wandered in search of him for a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas how could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed him someone proposed a regressive method to locate book a consult first book b which indicates as position to locate book b consult first a book c and so on to infinity  in adventures such as these i have squandered and wasted my years it does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe 3 i pray to the unknown gods that a man  just one even though it were thousands of years ago  may have examined and read it if honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me let them be for others let heaven exist though my place be in hell let me be outraged and annihilated but for one instant in one being let your enormous library be justified the impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the library and that the reasonable and even humble and pure coherence is an almost miraculous exception they speak i know of the feverish library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity these words which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well notoriously prove their authors abominable taste and desperate ignorance in truth the library includes all verbal structures all variations permitted by the twentyfive orthographical symbols but not a single example of absolute nonsense it is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled the combed thunderclap and another the plaster cramp and another axaxaxas ml these phrases at first glance incoherent can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner such a justification is verbal and ex hypothesi already figures in the library i cannot combine some characters

which the divine library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning no one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear which is not in one of these languages the powerful name of a god to speak is to fall into tautology this wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons  and its refutation as well an n number of possible languages use the same vocabulary in some of them the symbol library allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal galleries but library is bread or pyramid or anything else and these seven words which define it have another value you who read me are you sure of understanding my language
the methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men the certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms i know of districts in which the young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner but they do not know how to decipher a single letter epidemics heretical conflicts peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry have decimated the population i believe i have mentioned suicides more and more frequent with the years perhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me but i suspect that the human species  the unique species  is about to be extinguished but the library will endure illuminated solitary infinite perfectly motionless equipped with precious volumes useless incorruptible secret
i have just written the word infinite i have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit i say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite those who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end  which is absurd those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit i venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem the library is unlimited and cyclical if an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder which thus repeated would be an order the order my solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope 4

1 the original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters the punctuation has been limited to the comma and the period these two signs the space and the twentytwo letters of the alphabet are the twentyfive symbols considered sufficient by this unknown author editors note
2 before there was a man for every three hexagons suicide and pulmonary diseases have destroyed that proportion a memory of unspeakable melancholy at times i have traveled for many nights through corridors and along polished stairways without finding a single librarian
3 i repeat it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist only the impossible is excluded for example no book can be a ladder although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate and demonstrate this possibility and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder
4 letizia lvarez de toledo has observed that this vast library is useless rigorously speaking a single volume would be sufficient a volume of ordinary format printed in nine or ten point type containing an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves in the early seventeenth century cavalieri said that all solid bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes the handling of this silky vade mecum would not be convenient each apparent page would unfold into other analogous ones the inconceivable middle page would have no reverse
